# OopsyDaisy
SolidWorks Repository for Daisy-the-dog's prosthetic

For my Mechanical folks who hate don't use the terminal:
- Download GUI: https://desktop.github.com/

How to version control:
1. Clone repository

If making changes to a part: 
  Only push that part! 
  It will update the assembly for next person when they pull and open the assembly since it references the same part name.
  (Don't change the name unless you want a new part) 
  
If making changes to an assembly:
  make sure you check it out and no one else is trying to work on the same assembly.
